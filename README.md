# openKmip4j
This project aims to provide an open-source and fail-safely usable solution for using KMIP both on client and server sides. The usage of this implementation does not require deeper knowledge of the protocol itself as the API guides the user. Also this implementation aims to handle secrets (key material and passwords) in a tamperproof way implementing org.identityconnectors.common.security's GuardedString and GuardedByteArray.
